# File Permissions in Linux

## Project Description
This project is to exercise and confidently put to usage some Linux commands for managing file permissions. Understanding file permissions in Linux is crucial for cybersecurity professionals because it forms the foundation of access control and security on Linux systems. The research team at my organization needs to update the file permissions for certain files and directories within the projects directory. The permissions do not currently reflect the level of authorization that should be given. Checking and updating these permissions will help keep their system secure.
